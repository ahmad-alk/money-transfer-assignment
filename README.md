# money-transfer
Simple project service for money transfer built with Java.

# What dependencies I have used ?

* `JOOQ`: a fluent API for typesafe SQL query construction and execution.

* `JavaLin`: a very lightweight web framework for Kotlin and Java which supports WebSockets, HTTP2 and async requests. Javalinâ€™s main goals are simplicity, a great developer experience, and first class interoperability between Kotlin and Java.

* `HikariCP`: Fast, simple, reliable connection pool

* `h2database`: Embeddable RDBMS written in Java

* `flywaydb`: open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration

* `mockito`: Tasty mocking framework for unit tests in Java

* `rest-assured`: Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs

* `codearte.catch-exception`: catches exceptions in a single line of code and makes them available for further analysis.
